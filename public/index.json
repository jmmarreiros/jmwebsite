Different types of experiments can answer different questions; all types should therefore be combined to obtain a holistic view. In controlled experiments, some factors are tested, while the other factors are kept constant to improve the signal-to-noise ratio. Yet, controlled experiments have been conducted with variable degrees of control. Although they seem decoupled from archeological applications, mechanized experiments and the robust causal relationships they measure are critical to answer archeological questions like understanding the processes of use-wear formation. Here we introduce the concept behind using the SMARTTESTER®, a modular material tester, and we present four different setups (linear, rotary, percussion and oscillating) and their potential archeological applications. Such experiments will contribute to our understanding of causality in human tool use.","tags":["Experimental archaeology","Traceology","Repeatability"],"title":"A versatile mechanized setup for controlled experiments in archeology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["João Marreiros","Ivan Calandra","Walter Gneisinger","Eduardo Paixão","Antonella Pedergnana","Lisa Schunk"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1588550400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1588550400,"objectID":"5e7b2414ae99ff8a4f372f50e0db7d27","permalink":"/publication/2020_marreiros_jpla/","publishdate":"2020-05-04T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_marreiros_jpla/","section":"publication","summary":"In prehistoric human populations, technologies played a fundamental role in the acquisition of different resources and are represented in the main daily living activities, such as with bone, wooden, and stone-tipped spears for hunting, and chipped-stone tools for butchering. Considering that paleoanthropologists and archeologists are focused on the study of different processes involved in the evolution of human behavior, investigating how hominins acted in the past through the study of evidence on archeological artifacts is crucial. Thus, investigating tool use is of major importance for a comprehensive understanding of all processes that characterize human choices of raw materials, techniques, and tool types. Many functional assumptions of tool use have been based on tool design and morphology according to archeologists’ interpretations and ethnographic observations. Such assumptions are used as baselines when inferring human behavior and have driven an improvement in the methods and techniques employed in functional studies over the past few decades. Here, while arguing that use-wear analysis is a key discipline to assess past hominin tool use and to interpret the organization and variability of artifact types in the archeological record, we aim to review and discuss the current state-of-the-art methods, protocols, and their limitations. In doing so, our discussion focuses on three main topics: (1) the need for fundamental improvements by adopting established methods and techniques from similar research fields, (2) the need to implement and combine different levels of experimentation, and (3) the crucial need to establish standards and protocols in order to improve data quality, standardization, repeatability, and reproducibility. By adopting this perspective, we believe that studies will increase the reliability and applicability of use-wear methods on tool function. The need for a holistic approach that combines not only use-wear traces but also tool technology, design, curation, durability, and efficiency is also debated and revised. Such a revision is a crucial step if archeologists want to build major inferences on human decisionmaking behavior and biocultural evolution processes.","tags":["Traceology","Open access data","Repeatability","Experimental archaeology","Controlled experiments"],"title":"Rethinking Use-Wear Analysis and Experimentation as Applied to the Study of Past Hominin Tool Use","type":"publication"},{"authors":["João Marreiros","Telmo Pereira","Radu Iovita"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1585699200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1585699200,"objectID":"08ede69f2282e0751a4148cff9c439ee","permalink":"/publication/2020_marreiros_aasc/","publishdate":"2020-04-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_marreiros_aasc/","section":"publication","summary":"Controlled experiments have been regarded among archeologists with a certain degree of skepticism. This is in large part due to the perception that, in controlled setups, especially those employing machines, artifact production, or the experimental replication of their use is too far removed from authentic ancient human action to be meaningful. In that sense, the unease stems from a belief that, on the one hand, a machine is so unrealistic that whatever advantages might come from it are not helpful, and—on the other hand—that a mechanical device might introduce more biases than it helps resolve.","tags":["Experimental archaeology","Controlled Experiments","Lithics"],"title":"Controlled experiments in lithic technology and function","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jonathan Haws","Et al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1584921600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1584921600,"objectID":"2273b67e97d5408e5744e85673926865","permalink":"/publication/2019_haws_jfa/","publishdate":"2020-03-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_haws_jfa/","section":"publication","summary":"Here we report the results of an integrated geoarchaeological survey to study Palaeolithic human settlement dynamics in the coastal region of Portuguese Estremadura. The region has been an important focus of human occupation across multiple glacial-interglacial cycles, including periods of well-documented abrupt climate instability during MIS 3 and 2. The pedestrian survey covered a roughly 10 km wide strip of land between São Pedro de Muel and Peniche. The survey intensively targeted three landscape settings with Pleistocene-age surfaces and sediments: the coastal bluffs with exposed aeolian, fluvial, and colluvial sands; the Caldas da Rainha diapiric valley and associated fluvial/estuarine fills; and, Cretaceous chert-rich limestone uplands that bound the inland margin of the study area. We discovered dozens of new Palaeolithic sites, analyzed numerous Pleistocene sedimentary sections, and applied widespread OSL-dating to establish age control that allowed us to build a regional geomorphic history to contextualize Late Pleistocene human settlement across the region.","tags":["Middle Paleolithic","Lithics","Survey"],"title":"The effect of numerical aperture on quantitative use-wear studies and its implication on reproducibility","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jean-Jacques Hublin","Et al."],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1583884800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583884800,"objectID":"0a561cad0cf4c9b50f0314402e0b82c1","permalink":"/publication/2020_hublin_nature/","publishdate":"2020-03-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2020_hublin_nature/","section":"publication","summary":"The Middle to Upper Palaeolithic transition in Europe witnessed the replacement and partial absorption of local Neanderthal populations by Homo sapiens populations of African origin. However, this process probably varied across regions and its details remain largely unknown. In particular, the duration of chronological overlap between the two groups is much debated, as are the implications of this overlap for the nature of the biological and cultural interactions between Neanderthals and H. sapiens. Here we report the discovery and direct dating of human remains found in association with Initial Upper Palaeolithic artefacts, from excavations at Bacho Kiro Cave (Bulgaria). Morphological analysis of a tooth and mitochondrial DNA from several hominin bone fragments, identified through proteomic screening, assign these finds to H. sapiens and link the expansion of Initial Upper Palaeolithic technologies with the spread of H. sapiens into the mid-latitudes of Eurasia before 45 thousand years ago. The excavations yielded a wealth of bone artefacts, including pendants manufactured from cave bear teeth that are reminiscent of those later produced by the last Neanderthals of western Europe. These finds are consistent with models based on the arrival of multiple waves of H. sapiens into Europe coming into contact with declining Neanderthal populations.","tags":["Upper Paleolithic","Excavation","Lithics"],"title":"Initial Upper Palaeolithic Homo sapiens from Bacho Kiro Cave, Bulgaria","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Ivan Calandra","Lisa Schunk","Alica Rodriguez","Walter Gneisinger","Antonella Pedergnana","Eduardo Paixao","Telmo Pereira","Radu Iovita","João Marreiros"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1573430400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1573430400,"objectID":"d7f72e9c2fab1f32907191339c6d06fa","permalink":"/publication/2019_calandra_aasc/","publishdate":"2019-11-11T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/2019_calandra_aasc/","section":"publication","summary":"Use-wear studies rely heavily on experiments and reference collections to infer the function of archeological artifacts.

However, few paleontologists and archeologists are aware of this, and even those who are, do not take into account most of the methodological insights from the other field. In this focus article, we briefly review the main developmental steps of both methods, highlight how similar their histories are and how combining methodological developments can improve both research fields. In both cases, the traditional analyses have been strongly criticized mainly because of their subjectivity and their lack of repeatability and reproducibility. Quantitative surface texture analyses have been proposed in response, re- sulting in dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) and quantitative artifact microwear analysis (QAMA). DMTA is however a more mature method than QAMA and is well supported within the paleontological community. In this paper, focused on the methodological framework of both fields, we address this topic by arguing that traceologists could borrow a lot from DMTA; this would allow QAMA to become an established method much more quickly. Dental microwear analysts can also learn from traceology, especially regarding sample prepara- tion, experimentation and residue analysis. We hope that this focus article will stimulate more awareness, exchange and collaboration between pa- leontologists and archeologists, and especially between dental and artifact microwear analysts. Paleontology, archeology and the field of surface analysis as a whole would all benefit from such cooperation.","tags":["Traceology","Open access data","Reproducibility","Interdisciplinarity"],"title":"Why should traceology learn from dental microwear, and vice-versa?","type":"publication"}]
