summary: "On behalf of all my TraCEr team, I recently gave a talk at the AWRANA meeting, in Barcelona, about some ongoing experiments on using dental molding material to create high-resolution surface texture impressions of artifacts. 	In this talk we presented our experiments that aim at evaluating the accuracy, resolution, and durability of different types of molding silicone. The results of the experiment are very interesting and exciting, data shows that impressions are quite reliable, even a few months. 
We also addressed the dichotomy between qualitative and quantitative analysis, while seeking a common protocol between these two complementary approaches. This is a crucial technique not only in the field of use-wear analysis, but also dental micro wear. Further experiments are ongoing, and we hope to publish the results soon!"
