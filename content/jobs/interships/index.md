If you are interested on my research and want to collaborate, please get in touch! 
I also often welcome junior and senior researchers at TraCEr (MONREPOS-LEIZA) and ICArEHB for internships. These normally include training on use-wear analysis, experimental archaeology, and imaging equipment. 

I’m also happy to support PhD and postdoctoral applications, on topics such as archaeological sciences (applied to field archaeology), use-wear analysis and controlled experiments! 

*Drop me a message!*
