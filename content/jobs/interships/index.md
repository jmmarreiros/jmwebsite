If you are interested on my research and want to collaborate, please get in touch! I often welcome students at TraCEr (MONREPOS-LEIZA) and ICArEHB for internships. These normally include training on use-wear analysis, experimental archaeology, and imaging equipment. 

Iâ€™m also happy to support PhD and postdoctoral researchers in the field of use-wear analysis and controlled experiments!
