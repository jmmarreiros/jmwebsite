summary: "If you are interested on my research and want to collaborate, please get in touch. I often welcome students at TraCEr (MONREPOS-RGZM) and ICArEHB for internships. These normally include training on use-wear analysis, experiments, and imaging equipment. Iâ€™m also happy to support PhD and postdoctoral researchers in the field of use-wear analysis and controlled experiments! Contact me!"
