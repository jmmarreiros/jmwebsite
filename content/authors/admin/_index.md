**Welcome!** 
I’m an archaeologist, currently **working at the Laboratory for Traceology and Controlled Experiments (TraCEr) at MONREPOS** (www.tracermonrepos-blog.com), LEIZA (https://www.leiza.de/). I’m also an Affiliated Researcher at the ICArEHB (http://www.icarehb.com/). 

I’m interested on unraveling **early hominin technological evolution**, with special fascination on understanding how stone tools were designed, produced, and used. I found intriguing how technological choices made in the past guided us to what we are today.
To investigate this topic, I focus on: 1) understanding **when** and **where** the design and production of stone tools change over time (artefact analysis and field work), 2) the association between tool design (different forms) and **tool used**, and ultimately, 3) **why humans changed** the way they design and used their tools, and what does this tell us about changes on the evolution of human behavior (mainly via lab experimentation). 

This personal and independent website is about my research on Pleistocene Archaeology! The main aim is to *disseminate my research, share data and details about my projects in the lab and field*. Feel free to contact me if you have any ideas and/or inputs! They're all very welcome!

I'll be regularly updating this site with news on my projects, brief intros to my most recent published papers and other research material. Additionally, you can also find me online on **Twitter**, **GitHub** and **ResearchGate**.
