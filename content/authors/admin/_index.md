**Welcome!** 
I’m an archaeologist, currently working as a Research Group Leader at the Laboratory for Traceology and Controlled Experiments (TraCEr) at [LEIZA - MONREPOS](https://www.leiza.de/), and I’m also a Researcher at the [ICArEHB](http://www.icarehb.com). 

I am passionate about the evolution of technology. As an achaeologist, I’m interested in unravelling major steps on **early hominin technological evolution**, with a special focus on how stone tools were designed and used. I found it intriguing how technological choices made in the past guided us to what we are today. To investigate this topic, I focus on artefact analysis, laboratory experiments, and excavation of palaeolithic sites. 

This independent website is about my research on Pleistocene Archaeology! The main aim is to **disseminate my research, and share data and details about my projects in the lab and field**. Feel free to get in touch!

I'll regularly update this site with news on my projects, brief intros to my most recent published papers and other research material. You can also find me online on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/profile/jmarreiros.bsky.social).
