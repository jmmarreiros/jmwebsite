	abstract = {Use-wear analysis examines the macroscopic and microscopic patterns of traces left on tool surfaces as a result of use. Recently, machine learning ({ML}) has been employed as a promising method for automating and standardizing the identification of these traces. While the number of use-wear analysts using {ML} continues to grow, discussions regarding the effectiveness and appropriate implementation of these methods are ongoing. The main aim of this literature review is to provide recommendations for the more effective application of {ML} in use-wear analysis and archaeological research, by identifying trends, research gaps, and evaluating the quality of the models developed.},
