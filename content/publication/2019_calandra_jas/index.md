abstract: "Dental and artifact microwear analyses have a lot in common regarding the questions they address, their de- velopmental history and their issues. However, few paleontologists and archeologists are aware of this, and even those who are, do not take into account most of the methodological insights from the other field. In this focus article, we briefly review the main developmental steps of both methods, highlight how similar their histories are and how combining methodological developments can improve both research fields. In both cases, the traditional analyses have been strongly criticized mainly because of their subjectivity and their lack of repeatability and reproducibility. Quantitative surface texture analyses have been proposed in response, re- sulting in dental microwear texture analysis (DMTA) and quantitative artifact microwear analysis (QAMA). DMTA is however a more mature method than QAMA and is well supported within the paleontological community. In this paper, focused on the methodological framework of both fields, we address this topic by arguing that traceologists could borrow a lot from DMTA; this would allow QAMA to become an established method much more quickly. Dental microwear analysts can also learn from traceology, especially regarding sample prepara- tion, experimentation and residue analysis. We hope that this focus article will stimulate more awareness, exchange and collaboration between pa- leontologists and archeologists, and especially between dental and artifact microwear analysts. Paleontology, archeology and the field of surface analysis as a whole would all benefit from such cooperation."

summary: Interdisciplinarity leads to fundamental knowledge and methods combination between disciplines. Having this in mind, in this paper we track all major theoretical and methodological developments on two closed-related disciplines, dental microwear and use-wear. The main goal here was to discuss how the two disciplines improved and, at the same time, how much still need to be done in order to combine both methodologies and approaches. While methods seems to that have been established in one discipline, they tend to be marginally applied in the other.
