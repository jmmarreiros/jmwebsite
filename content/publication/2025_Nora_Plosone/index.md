abstract: "The physical properties of distinct raw materials, such as hardness, homogeneity, and grain size, have been recurrently suggested as some of the key reasons for human decision-making, namely the selection, production, and use of stone implements in the past. However, little is known, concerning the relationship between stone tools and human behaviour and how this is reflected in the variability seen in the archaeological record. Therefore, investigating stone tools’ properties and performance brings fundamental insights into identifying and understanding the origins of some of the major human technological behavioural traits. In this study, we aim to address this topic by measuring the variability of the properties of lithic raw materials from the perspective of tool use. A controlled experiment was designed to test the mechanical performance with a focus on the efficiency (ratio between effectiveness and durability) of four distinct raw materials (quartzite, dacite, flint, and obsidian). Our study addresses the null hypothesis, Edge efficiency does not vary according to the different lithic raw materials. Efficiency is assessedby the combination of penetration depth (proxy to measure effectiveness) and edge wear (proxy to measure durability). These two variables were measured, and the results correlated with the physical properties of various raw materials, including hardness and grain size. Our results show significant differences in the efficiency between the different types of raw materials. The outcome demonstrates that the variables by which we test the edge efficiency of lithic raw materials are highly relevant for raw material selection and, consequently, may have been of utmost importance in influencing the decision-aking process of past hunter-gatherers. A decrease in tool efficiency during use may have constrained daily activities, necessitating technological adaptations. This strongly suggests that each raw material used in archaeological contexts to produce blanks should be evaluated for its efficiency. In addition, it may be pertinent to extend this approach to other blunt artefactssuch as scrapers, burins, anvils, and hammerstones when investigating aspects of interconnected behaviours such as artefact variability, resource economy, group mobility, and site function. Such choices and decisions are coded in the archaeological record and represent cultural factors that were transmitted through learning and likely triggered the human decision-making process of past hunter-gatherers."

summary: In this experiment we tested how different stone raw materials perform as tools—specifically looking at four types, flint, dacite, quartzite and obsidian. We cut into pinewood under identical conditions and measured two key things, how deep the tool edge cuts (effectiveness) and how much the edge wore down (durability).  We also measured material‐properties like hardness and grain size to see how those link to performance.  What we looked at, Does tool edge efficiency vary with raw material type? (Our null hypothesis was that it doesn’t.) Which materials cut the deepest and also resist wear the best?	How do traditional categories of high quality vs low quality raw materials hold up when tested quantitatively under use? We found that the different raw materials behaved very differently, flint showed the highest overall performance (deep cuts and moderate wear). Quartzite, though often considered low quality performed surprisingly well once the initial edge fragmentation settled. Obsidian was brittle and wore fast; dacite had good early performance but then plateaued. Additionally, the classic fine‐grain vs coarse‐grain raw material classification (flint is fine, quartzite is coarse) is too simplistic, some coarse‐grained materials (like quartzite here) can be efficient tool materials under certain conditions. For archaeologists this study gives us experimental data that supports the idea that raw material choice was not random. People in the past likely made technological decisions based on performance of the tool‐materials, not just availability. It also suggests that when you see certain raw materials in the archaeological record, you might infer something about the tasks they were used for, the mobility or procurement strategies of tool‐makers, or even maintenance and resharpening practices.
