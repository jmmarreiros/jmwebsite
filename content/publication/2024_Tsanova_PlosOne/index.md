abstract: "The dispersal of Homo sapiens across Eurasia during MIS 3 in the Late Pleistocene is marked by technological shifts and other behavioral changes, known in the archaeological record under the term of Initial Upper Paleolithic (IUP). Bacho Kiro Cave in north Bulgaria, re-excavated by us from 2015 to 2021, is one of the reference sites for this phenomenon. The newly excavated lithic assemblages dated by radiocarbon between 45,040 and 43,280 cal BP and attributed to Homo sapiens encompass more than two thousand lithic artifacts. The lithics, primarily from Layer N1-I, exist amid diverse fauna remains, human fossils, pierced animal teeth pendants, and sediment with high organic content. This article focuses on the technological aspects of the IUP lithics, covering raw material origin and use-life, blank production, on-site knapping activities, re-flaking of lithic implements, and the state of retouched lithic components. We apply petrography for the identification of silicites and other used stones. We employ chaîne opératoire and reduction sequence approaches to profile the lithics techno-typologically and explore the lithic economy, particularly blade production methods, knapping techniques, and artifact curation. Raw material analysis reveals Lower Cretaceous flints from Ludogorie and Upper Cretaceous flints from the Danube region, up to 190 km and 130 km, respectively, from Bacho Kiro Cave, indicating long-distance mobility and finished products transport. Imported lithic implements, were a result of unidirectional and bidirectional non-Levallois laminar technology, likely of volumetric concept. Systematic on-anvil techniques (bipolar knapping) and tool segmentation indicate re-flaking and reshaping of lithic implements, reflecting on-site curation and multifaceted lithic economy. A limited comparison with other IUP sites reveals certain shared features and also regional variations. Bacho Kiro Cave significantly contributes to understanding the technological and behavioral evolution of early Homo sapiens in western Eurasia."

summary: Our investigation reported in this article focus on the study of over 2,000 lithic (stone) artefacts excavated at the site of Bacho Kiro Cave in Bulgaria from layers dated to about 45,040–43,280 cal BP. We analysed raw materials using petrography and identified many artefacts made from flint sourced some 130–190 kilometres from the cave; we also mapped and classified how the tools were produced, modified and re-worked. We applied chaîne opératoire and reduction sequence approaches (i.e., when and how blanks were produced, how tools were curated and re-used) to understand not just “what” tools were made, but how and where they were used and modified. We found that a large proportion of tools were made from non-local flint: Lower Cretaceous flints from the Ludogorie area (≈160-190 km away) accounted for ~62% of identified types; Upper Cretaceous flints from the Danube region (~110-130 km away) also appear in the assemblage. The technology is dominated by flakes (35.87%), blades (15.18%), and retouched blanks (15.04%). Minimal core production suggests that many tools were brought in already worked (or blanks transported) and then maintained rather than produced fully on site. In summary, the assemblage suggests deliberate selection and transport of finished or semi-finished products and a high level of tool curation — not simply production and discard based on local materials.
