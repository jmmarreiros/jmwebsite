abstract: "The evolution of human behaviour is marked by key decision-making processes reflected in technological variability in the early archaeological record. As part of the technological system, differences in raw material quality directly affect the way that humans produce, design and use stone tools. The selection, procurement and use of various raw materials requires decision-making to evaluate multiple factors such as suitability to produce and design tools, but also the materials’ efficiency and durability in performing a given task. Therefore, characterizing the physical properties of various lithic raw materials is crucial for exploring changes in human interactions with their natural environment through time and space and for understanding their technological behaviour. In this paper, we present the first step in an ongoing program designed to understand the decision-making criteria involved in the use of raw materials by the early Acheulian tool-makers at the Melka Wakena (MW) site-complex, located on the Ethiopian highlands. We present the results of the first experimental step, in which we identified and measured the engineering properties of raw materials in the lithic assemblages. These data serve as an objective, quantifiable baseline for natural experiments as well as archaeological inquiries into the technological decision-making processes of early Pleistocene hominins in Africa."

summary: What we did: In this paper we looked at how early hominins (tool‐making humans) at the site complex Melka Wakena in the Ethiopian highlands chose different stone materials for making percussive tools (like hammerstones). We gathered stone samples of different rock types found in that area. We measured their physical and engineering properties to see how the raw materials might differ in performance. We found measurable differences in the rock types: harder and denser rocks tended to show less volume loss (i.e., less damage) under the same experimental stress. For example, one rock (glassy ignimbrite) showed very low visible damage at macroscopic scale compared with others. It gives us concrete evidence that early humans weren’t just randomly picking stones; they may have been making informed decisions about which rocks to use for tools based on their likely durability and suitability for the task. This adds to our understanding of cognitive and technological behaviours in deep prehistory. Also, by establishing a baseline of raw material properties, we can later compare actual archaeological tools and see how performance and raw material choice relate.
