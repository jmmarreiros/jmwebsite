abstract: "Controlled experiments have been regarded among archeologists with a certain degree of skepticism. This is in large part due to the perception that, in controlled setups, especially those employing machines, artifact production, or the experimental replication of their use is too far removed from authentic ancient human action to be meaningful. In that sense, the unease stems from a belief that, on the one hand, a machine is so unrealistic that whatever advantages might come from it are not helpful, and—on the other hand—that a mechanical device might introduce more biases than it helps resolve."
