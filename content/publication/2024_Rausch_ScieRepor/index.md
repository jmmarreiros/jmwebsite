abstract: "Information about the use of stone tools in the past is encoded in the wear patterns left on their
surface; however, post-depositional processes can modify and obstruct these traces. One aim in the
field of lithic functional analysis is to develop methods to detect and quantify these traces on stone
tools. The occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA) is a well-established method in dental wear studies to
virtually simulate dental occlusal (contact between teeth) stroke movements and thus locate and
quantify the sequential contact between opposing tooth crowns. Reaching across disciplines, we
conducted controlled experiments to test the applicability of the OFA method on stone tools to
address the challenge of use-wear quantification and localisation, and therefore the identification of
post-depositional wear. Our findings reveal a clear overlap between zones of experimentally produced
use-wear and OFA-calculated contact areas. We demonstrate OFA as a potential method to generate
models of multiscale use-wear that can be used as references on experimental tools to identify post-
depositional surface modifications on stone tool artefacts."

summary: We ran a bunch of controlled cutting experiments using stone tools, some with simple straight edges and others knapped and retouched. We used a mechanical tester to make each tool perform 2000 identical cutting strokes—either on softwood or on synthetic bone, so we could see how use-wear develops under tightly controlled conditions. While doing that, we 3D-scanned the tools and used a method borrowed from dental research (Occlusal Fingerprint Analysis, OFA) to simulate exactly where the tool should touch the worked material during cutting. 
We wanted to know whether the areas predicted by the simulation actually match where polish and other use-wear traces show up on the tools after the experiments.
We also tested how much the shape of the tool and the hardness of the worked material influence where and how wear forms.
The simulated contact zones and the real use-wear areas overlapped surprisingly well—especially for wood. The simulations tended to predict slightly bigger contact zones than the polish we actually saw, but the overall patterns matched. This approach could be used to build “wear prediction libraries” that help archaeologists understand how different stone-tool shapes and materials would wear during actual use. It could even help distinguish true use-wear from natural damage. Basically, the study shows that combining controlled experiments, 3D modelling, and simulations can give us much clearer insight into how stone tools were used in the past.
