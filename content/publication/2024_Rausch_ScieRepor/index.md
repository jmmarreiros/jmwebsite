abstract: "Information about the use of stone tools in the past is encoded in the wear patterns left on their
surface; however, post-depositional processes can modify and obstruct these traces. One aim in the
field of lithic functional analysis is to develop methods to detect and quantify these traces on stone
tools. The occlusal fingerprint analysis (OFA) is a well-established method in dental wear studies to
virtually simulate dental occlusal (contact between teeth) stroke movements and thus locate and
quantify the sequential contact between opposing tooth crowns. Reaching across disciplines, we
conducted controlled experiments to test the applicability of the OFA method on stone tools to
address the challenge of use-wear quantification and localisation, and therefore the identification of
post-depositional wear. Our findings reveal a clear overlap between zones of experimentally produced
use-wear and OFA-calculated contact areas. We demonstrate OFA as a potential method to generate
models of multiscale use-wear that can be used as references on experimental tools to identify post-
depositional surface modifications on stone tool artefacts."
