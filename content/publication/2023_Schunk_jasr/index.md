abstract: "Traceological studies aim at the recognition and the identification of use-wear traces on artefacts to gain a functional interpretation of past human technologies. However, the development of use-wear traces is known to be dependent on different mechanics involved, such as those related to the contact materials, but also to the tool raw material and morphology, the use intensity and the performed task. Therefore, an understanding of the fundamental mechanics affecting wear formation is necessary to build reliable interpretations based on causation.
The cause-effect relationship between individual variables and the formation of use-wear can only be investigated by conducting controlled, second-generation experiments. To test individual variables, others have to be standardised. This applies, for instance, to the contact material.
The here presented sequential second-generation experiment tested for differences between soft and hard contact materials. Simultaneously, this experiment aimed to validate the comparability of artificial and natural contact material as a standardised substitute, but also as an ethically more acceptable choice. Combined with qualitative and quantitative use-wear analyses, the data generated throughout the experiment did not only provide insights into the development of use-wear, but also into abrasion processes within the experimental setup. Concerning these aspects, no significant difference between the natural and artificial contact materials could be observed. Consequently, while not used as direct proxies to interpret wear on archaeological artefacts, the use of standardised contact materials can be an advantageous choice in controlled experimental setups. Moreover, the experiment highlights the relevance of use intensity and duration in the context of wear formation."

summary: This paper is dedicated to the evaluate the importance of using standard contact material in laboratory experimental replications, in particular in use-wear studies. 
We ran controlled experiments to see how using artificial materials (instead of natural ones) as the contact surface affects the wear and polish that develop on stone tools. In other words: we wanted to test whether “fake” materials (used in experiments) behave similarly to “real” worked materials in producing use-wear traces.
What we looked at:
	•	Do artificial contact materials generate wear (especially polish) that’s comparable to what we see when tools are used on natural materials?
	•	How strongly do different variables (tool material, contact material, motion, duration) affect the polish formation?
	•	Can we trust experiments using artificial materials to produce valid analogues for archaeological tools?
What we found:
	•	Yes, artificial contact materials can produce recognizable wear and polish, but the nature of the contact material still matters a lot.
	•	The choice of contact material strongly influences how the polish forms (its appearance, size, intensity).
	•	Because the wear outcomes vary so much depending on contact material, using artificial materials in experiments must be done carefully—properly documenting and controlling the variables is key for interpretation.

This study shows that when archaeologists run use‐wear experiments, the “target” material (the substance the tool contacts) critically shapes the wear traces. If the target is artificial, differences from natural behaviour could mislead functional interpretations unless the experiment is well documented. It raises important caution about how experimental results are used to interpret archaeological tools.
