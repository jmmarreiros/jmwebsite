abstract: "In archaeological research, identifying variability in the archaeological record helps us decode and reconstruct past human actions. To do so, archaeologists build concepts, definitions, and interpretations using middle-range theory, including analysis of ethnographic observations or hypothesis testing. Hence, when studying the archaeological record, experimental replication of potential past human activities is used to make inferences about how technology was used in the past, allowing archaeologists to reconstruct human behavioural processes (Ascher, 1961, Carrell, 1992, Coles, 1979, Ferguson and Neeley, 2010, Outram, 2008). In other words, experimentation in archaeological research has been used as a crucial method to evaluate hypotheses and assumptions based on researchers’ initial observations and interpretations."

summary: This paper is a introductory note to a organised symposium at the EAA conference meeting. Participation in this symposium aimed at presenting and discussion studies focusing on the relevance of contact material used on use-wear-related experimentation. The paper provides a general framework and brief summeary of each contribution! It was a very useful and fun session! Thanks to all participants. Several papers have been published in the same JASr issue.
